# Continuous integration

Repositories containing running software shall use
an appropriate continuous integration platform, such as
[travis](https://travis-ci.org/) or similar, to show whether the
current build passes all checks. This helps understand contributors
that the software passes tests on an independent platform, and
may give insights in the way the software is compiled, deployed
and tested.
